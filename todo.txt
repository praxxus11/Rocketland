-> add collision between rocket and the floor 
    -> torque, etc.
-> implement suggestions from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17910297/inheriting-from-transformable-and-drawable-in-sfml
    -> needed to convert to a game object
        -> floor, gif

-> the amount that the rockek goes down should not depend on the explosion 
    -> should depende on the velocity that it is falling

-> chaning the origin for means of rotation causes inconsitencies where you have to assume the origin is at the top left corner
    -> for eample the racket is not properly going into the ground after a crash
// long term changes
-> add engines
-> determine the center of mass and intertia of rocket
-> mass and stuff
