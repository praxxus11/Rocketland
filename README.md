## Branches

This project contains 4 branches: autoColabMerge, HumanControlled, presentation, and verifygpu (testing branch).

This is branch *presentation*. This contains only CPU code and is used for demonstrations. Additional features not relevant to training are included such as a visualization of the neural network that controls the rocket. Descriptions for other branches can be found on their respective readmes.

## Dependencies

This project uses SFML 2.5.1 and Eigen 3.3.9. You must have the CUDA toolkit installed with the nvcc compiler if usage with GPU is desired.
